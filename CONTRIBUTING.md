# Contributing to CMAS

## Why contribute

- **It's a real, public artefact you can point to.** A well-written concept page
  or a clean set of practice-exam questions is something you can link on a
  resume or portfolio.
- Writing notes up and taking responsibility for the wiki quality will help you while you help others.**
- **Compounding effort.** Every source you ingest saves the next contributor
  (including future-you, revising for the exam) from starting cold. The wiki
  gets more useful with every contribution.

## What to contribute

- **A source page**: ingest a lecture, reading, or paper you've gone through
  (see the `wiki_ingest` skill).
- **A concept or entity page**: fill in or improve an existing page, add a `## Formula` section, or fix a definition that's unclear or wrong.
- **Material**: worked examples, a synthesis comparing two concepts, revision
  notes, or a generated practice exam / cue-card deck you found useful.
- **Wiki health**: run `wiki_lint` and fix what it finds (dangling links,
  orphan pages, missing frontmatter).

You don't need to be an AI/agent power-user to contribute: plain Markdown edits
in Obsidian or any editor are just as welcome as agent-assisted ones.

## Content conventions

Full schema: [`.claude/wiki-schema.md`](.claude/wiki-schema.md). Quick
reference: [`RULES.md`](RULES.md). The essentials:

- Pages live under `wiki/{sources,entities,concepts,materials}/`, kebab-case
  filenames, YAML frontmatter with at least `title`, `type`, `tags`, `date`.
- Use `[[wikilinks]]` for cross-references; both Obsidian and the Quartz-built
  site resolve them.
- **No copyrighted material.** University of Melbourne lecture slides, PDFs, and
  recordings are copyright. Never commit the original file or a copy-pasted
  excerpt. Source pages hold a `link` to the original (e.g. the Canvas URL) plus
  an original summary.
- Run the lint check before opening a PR. Ask the agent for `wiki_lint`, or run the
  script directly once the plugin is installed:
  ```bash
  python3 ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/wiki-skills/plugins/wiki/skills/wiki_lint/lint.py
  ```

## Using the AI agents

This is explicitly an *agentic* wiki (in the spirit of Andrej Karpathy's
append-only LLM wiki pattern). The skills that automate most of the mechanical work
live in the [wiki-skills](https://github.com/bronsonhill/wiki-skills) plugin, shared with other wikis; this repo supplies only
the configuration they read, in [`.claude/wiki-schema.md`](.claude/wiki-schema.md).

| Skill | Use it to... |
|---|---|
| `lecture-digest` | Turn lecture videos + slides into a layered digest you can read instead of watching |
| `wiki_ingest` | Turn a source (lecture, paper, video) into a source page + linked concept/entity pages |
| `wiki_lint` | Check the wiki's health before/after a PR |
| `wiki_query` | Ask a question across the wiki and get a cited answer |
| `cue-cards` | Generate spaced-repetition flashcards (Obsidian Spaced Repetition + Anki export) from any page |
| `practice-exam` | Generate a typeset LaTeX practice exam from wiki content |

Claude Code picks the plugin up automatically from `.claude/settings.json` when you open
this repo, prompting you to trust the marketplace the first time. To install it by hand:

```
/plugin marketplace add bronsonhill/wiki-skills
/plugin install wiki@wiki-skills
```

With the plugin installed, just
describe what you want ("ingest this lecture", "make cue cards on cellular
automata") and the relevant skill takes over. You're still the reviewer. So
check the output before it goes in a PR, especially for factual accuracy.

You don't need an AI agent to contribute. Hand-written pages that follow the same
conventions are equally welcome.

## Local dev setup

```bash
npm install
npx quartz build --serve
```

This serves the built site locally so you can preview how your content renders.
Requires Node ≥ 22 (see `.node-version`). Alternatively, just open `wiki/` in
Obsidian or VS Code — it's a plain Markdown vault, no build step needed to read
or edit it.

## PR / git workflow

1. Fork the repo (or branch, if you have write access).
2. Make your changes under `wiki/` (and, if you're changing the schema, under
   `.claude/`). Changes to the skills themselves go to the [wiki-skills](https://github.com/bronsonhill/wiki-skills) repo.
3. Run `python3 ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/wiki-skills/plugins/wiki/skills/wiki_lint/lint.py` and resolve what it flags.
4. Commit with a clear, scoped message, e.g.:
   ```
   ingest: Cellular Automata lecture — added 4 concepts, 2 entities
   ```
5. Open a PR against `main`. Briefly describe what you added/changed and which
   lecture/source it's based on.
6. Don't push directly to `main` — even small fixes go through a PR, so changes
   are visible and reviewable.

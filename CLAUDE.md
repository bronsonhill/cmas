# CLAUDE.md

Orientation for working in this repo. Don't duplicate detail that lives elsewhere —
follow the pointers.

## What this is

A public, agent-assisted wiki for the CMAS (Computational Modelling and Simulation)
subject, built as a [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) site over a plain Obsidian
vault. Two parts:

- `wiki/` — the content (Obsidian vault, also the Quartz build source). Structure,
  frontmatter, and page conventions: `.claude/wiki-schema.md`. Day-to-day formatting
  rules: `RULES.md`.
- `quartz/` — the site generator itself (vendored framework code). Rarely needs
  touching for wiki work; `quartz/cli/args.js` sets the default content directory
  to `wiki`.

## Before editing `wiki/`

Read `.claude/wiki-schema.md` first if you haven't already this session. The one
rule that's easy to violate by accident: **never copy University of Melbourne
course material into the repo** (slides, PDFs, recordings, transcripts) — it's
copyright and this repo is public. Source pages hold a link plus an original
summary, never the material itself.

## Skills

The workflows for growing and maintaining the wiki come from the [wiki-skills](https://github.com/bronsonhill/wiki-skills)
plugin, enabled for this repo via `.claude/settings.json`. Use them rather than
hand-rolling the equivalent:

- `content-digest` — turn ingested material into a layered digest you can read instead of the original
- `ingest` — add a source (lecture/paper/video) as a page + linked concepts/entities; captures transcripts for recordings
- `lint` — health check; run before any PR touching `wiki/`
- `query` — answer a question by synthesizing across the wiki with citations
- `cue-cards` — generate spaced-repetition decks (Obsidian SR + Anki export)
- `practice-exam` — generate a typeset LaTeX practice exam from wiki content

## Commands

```bash
npm install
npx quartz build --serve       # local preview, reads from wiki/
python3 ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/wiki-skills/plugins/wiki/skills/lint/lint.py   # wiki health check
```

## Contributing / git

Normal branch + PR workflow, never push straight to `main` — see
`CONTRIBUTING.md` for the full flow.
